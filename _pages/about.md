My research interest broadly lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computational Social Science (CSS)**, and **Social Media Mining and Analysis**. The landscape of social media is highly dynamic, with users generating and consuming a diverse range of content. Interest groups, including politicians and advertisers, employ microtargeting to shape messages and influence their audience. While effective in enhancing content relevance, microtargeting also presents risks such as manipulating user behavior, creating echo chambers, and fostering polarization. Understanding these impacts is crucial for promoting healthy public discourse in the digital age and maintaining a cohesive society. **My work focuses on a better understanding of microtargeting and activity patterns in social media.**

A significant challenge lies in understanding the messaging and how it changes depending on the targeted user groups. Another challenge arises when we do not know who the users are and what their motivations are for engaging with content. I address these challenges by developing computational approaches for (1) characterizing user types and their motivations
for engaging with content <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19298" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2022]</a> <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18057" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2021] </a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378461" style="color: #8B4513;" > [KDDBHI @IEEE BigData 2020] </a>,
(2) analyzing the messaging consumed by users and their responses to it  <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22156" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2023]</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604665" style="color: #8B4513;" > [AIES 2023]</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021123" style="color: #8B4513;" > [IEEE BigData 2022] </a>, (3) delving into the deeper understanding
of the theme and arguments involved in the content

<!--I focus on understanding the dynamic nature of social media content and its utilization by various interest groups for microtargeting. This involves overcoming challenges in understanding messaging tailored to specific user groups and identifying user types and motivations. I am interested in **understanding microtargeting patterns** on social media. -->
<!-- The information provided in super-connected media is often shaped by people's underlying lifestyle, well-being, health related choices and motivations, which may attract specific stakeholders to advance their interests to interact with potential users by adapting their messaging. I am interested in **characterizing users** and **messaging** on social media. -->

<!-- Working towards this goal, I study the following topics:
