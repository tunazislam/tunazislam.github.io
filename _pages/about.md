I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I earned my Ph.D. in CS from Purdue University, advised by [Dr. Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I obtained M.Sc. in [Computer Science (CS)](https://odu.edu/compsci) from [Old Dominion University (ODU)](https://www.odu.edu/#prospective). I completed my B.Sc in [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).
<!--- Prior to joining ODU, I worked as a software developer on the R&D team of [Dohatec New Media](http://www.dohatec.com/) for two years. -->

Research Overview
======
My research interests broadly lie in **AI for Societal Impact**, at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Social Science (CSS)**. I design scalable, explainable, collaborative, and socially responsible AI methods to tackle challenges in ***microtargeting analysis***, ***discourse understanding***, ***responsible AI integration***, and ***human–AI collaboration***. These approaches are applied to socially significant domains, including *elections*, *climate debates*, *COVID-19 vaccine debates*, *lifestyle choices* (*yoga*, *keto*, *veganism*), *immigration*, and *manufacturing training*. See the <a href="https://tunazislam.github.io/research/" style="color: #8B4513;" > <b>research details here</b> </a>. 
<br>
My research has been published in prominent venues such as AAAI ICWSM, NAACL, EMNLP, AAAI, ACL, AAAI/ACM AIES, ACM WebSci, IEEE Big Data.
