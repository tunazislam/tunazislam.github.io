My primary research interest lies in **computational social science (CSS)**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **social
media mining and analysis**. We now live in a world where we can reach people directly through social media without relying on traditional media such as television and radio. On the other hand, social media platforms collect vast amounts of data and create very specific profiles of different users
through targeted advertising. While effective in enhancing content relevance, *microtargeting* poses risks of manipulating user behavior, creating echo chambers, and fostering polarization. My research vision is to understand ***microtargeting*** and ***activity patterns*** on social media
by developing computational approaches and frameworks blending CSS, NLP, and artificial intelligence (AI). 

A significant challenge lies in understanding the messaging and how it changes depending on the targeted user groups. Another challenge arises when we do not know who the users are and what their motivations are for engaging with content. I address these challenges by developing computational approaches for (1) **characterizing user types and their motivations
for engaging with content** <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19298" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2022]</a> <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18057" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2021] </a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9364605" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICSC 2021] </a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378461" style="color: #8B4513;" > [IEEE BigData 2020] </a>;
(2) **analyzing the messaging consumed by users and their responses to it** <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22156" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2023]</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604665" style="color: #8B4513;" > [AIES 2023]</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021123" style="color: #8B4513;" > [IEEE BigData 2022] </a>; (3) **delving into the deeper understanding
of the theme and arguments involved in the content** 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10259.pdf" style="color: #8B4513;" > [NAACL 2025]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10707.pdf" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2025]</a> <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.313/" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ACL 2023]</a> <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.dash-1.13.pdf" style="color: #8B4513;" > [DASH @EMNLP 2022]</a> <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.427.pdf" style="color: #8B4513;" > [NAACL 2022]</a>. 

A major challenge is understanding the harmful effects of messaging choices when it comes to reinforcing ***bias*** and ***stereotypes***. Doing that requires us to scale up this analysis and adapt to ongoing continuous changing messaging. I study leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** to analyze societal opinions <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10259.pdf" style="color: #8B4513;" > [NAACL 2025]</a>; biases in microtargeting <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05401" style="color: #8B4513;" > [Preprint 2024]</a>; foster human-AI collaboration in complex psycho-linguistic tasks <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01991" style="color: #8B4513;" > [WebSci 2025]</a>; create AI-driven insights that inform policymaking and promote positive societal change. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. in [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Dr. Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I am fortunate to collaborate with [Dr. Ming Yin](https://mingyin.org/), [Dr. Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/), and [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/).
I obtained M.Sc. in [Computer Science (CS)](https://odu.edu/compsci) from [Old Dominion University (ODU)](https://www.odu.edu/#prospective) in 2018. Prior to joining ODU, I worked as a software developer on the R&D team of [Dohatec New Media](http://www.dohatec.com/) for two years. I completed my B.Sc in [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) department from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/) in the year 2013.

<!-- My research interest broadly lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computational Social Science (CSS)**, and **Social Media Mining and Analysis**. The landscape of social media is highly dynamic, with users generating and consuming a diverse range of content. Interest groups, including politicians and advertisers, employ microtargeting to shape messages and influence their audience. While effective in enhancing content relevance, microtargeting also presents risks such as manipulating user behavior, creating echo chambers, and fostering polarization. Understanding these impacts is crucial for promoting healthy public discourse in the digital age and maintaining a cohesive society. **My work focuses on a better understanding of microtargeting and activity patterns in social media.** -->
