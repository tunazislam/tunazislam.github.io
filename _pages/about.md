I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University, West Lafayette](https://www.purdue.edu/). My advisor is [Dr. Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/).
My research interest broadly lies in **Social Media Mining and Analysis**, integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Social Science (CSS)**. I focus on understanding the dynamic nature of social media content and its utilization by various interest groups for microtargeting. This involves overcoming challenges in understanding messaging tailored to specific user groups and identifying user types and motivations. I am interested in **understanding microtargeting pattern** on social media.

<!-- The information provided in super-connected media is often shaped by people's underlying lifestyle, well-being, health related choices and motivations, which may attract specific stakeholders to advance their interests to interact with potential users by adapting their messaging. I am interested in **characterizing users** and **messaging** on social media. -->

Working towards this goal, I study the following topics:
(1) Understanding people's well-being & lifestyle choices and analyzing their motivation behind this from social media data <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19298" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2022]</a> <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18057" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2021] </a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378461" style="color: #8B4513;" > [KDDBHI @IEEE BigData 2020] </a>.
(2) Analyzing the messaging consumed by users and their responses to it  <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22156" style="color: #8B4513;" > [ICWSM 2023]</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604665" style="color: #8B4513;" > [AIES 2023]</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021123" style="color: #8B4513;" > [IEEE BigData 2022] </a>. (3) Delving into the deeper understanding
of the theme and arguments involved in the content
