## Abstract
Because of the rapidly growing access of social media platforms, it provides convenient means for users to participate in multiple online activities on various contents and create fast widespread interactions. However, characterizing user types to understand peopleâ€™s lifestyle decisions shared in social media is challenging task due to diverse information. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised graph embedding based framework for creating user representation to understand user types. We evaluate the user embedding learned using weak supervision over well-being related tweets from Twitter, focusing on 'Yoga', 'Keto diet'.  Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines for detecting user types. Finally, we illustrate data analysis on different types of users (e.g., practitioner vs. promotional) from our dataset. While we focus on lifestyle-related tweets (i.e., yoga, keto), our method for constructing user representation readily generalizes to other domains.
