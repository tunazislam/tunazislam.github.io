## Abstract
It is currently impossible to get complete de novo assembly of segmentally duplicated genome regions using genome-wide short-read datasets.
Here, we devise a new computational method called Regional Extension of Assemblies Using Linked-Reads (REXTAL) for improved region-specific
assembly of segmental duplication-containing DNA, leveraging genomic short-read datasets generated from large DNA molecules partitioned and 
barcoded using the Gel Bead in Emulsion (GEM) microfluidic method [1]. We show that using REXTAL, it is possible to extend assembly of 
single-copy diploid DNA into adjacent, otherwise inaccessible subtelomere segmental duplication regions and other subtelomeric gap regions.
Moreover, REXTAL is computationally more efficient for the directed assembly of such regions from multiple genomes (e.g., for the 
comparison of structural variation) than genomewide assembly approaches.
