## Abstract
Multiview formulation of data is required to construct coherent and contextualized user representation on social media. Our paper suggests a joint embedding model by incorporating users’ social and textual information to learn contextualized user representation to understand users’ lifestyle choices. In this work, we use well-being related tweets from Twitter, focusing on 'Yoga' and 'Keto diet’. We compare our model’s performance against several other modeling choices and our model outperforms those baselines. We illustrate data collection and annotation details as well as in-depth data analysis of users from different classes.
