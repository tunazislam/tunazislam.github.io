## Abstract
Now-a-days social media is a huge platform of data. People usually share their interest, thoughts via discussions, tweets, status. It is not possible to go through all the data manually. We need to mine the data to explore hidden patterns or unknown correlations, find out dominant topic in data and understand people's interest through the discussions. In this paper, we explore Twitter data related to health. We extract the popular topics under different categories (e.g. diet, exercise) discussed in Twitter via topic modeling, observe model behavior on new tweets, accuracy assessment using ground truth by doing manual annotation both for train and test data and discover interesting correlation (i.e. Yoga-Veganism).
