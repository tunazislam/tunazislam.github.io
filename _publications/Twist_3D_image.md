## Abstract
Electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-EM) technique produces density maps that are 3-dimensional (3D) images of molecules. It is
challenging to derive atomic structures of proteins from 3D images of medium resolutions. Twist of a β-strand has been studied extensively 
while little of the known information has been directly obtained from the 3D image of a β-sheet. We describe a method to characterize the 
twist of β-strands from the 3D image of a protein. An analysis of 11 β-sheet images shows that the Averaged Minimum Twist (AMT) angle is 
larger for a close set than for a far set of β-traces.
