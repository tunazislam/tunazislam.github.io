## Abstract
Since most machine learning models provide no explanations for the predictions, their predictions are obscure for the human. The ability to explain a model's prediction has become a necessity in many applications including Twitter mining. In this work, we propose a method called Explainable Twitter Mining (Ex-Twit) combining Topic Modeling and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) to predict the topic and explain the model predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Ex-Twit on Twitter health-related data.
