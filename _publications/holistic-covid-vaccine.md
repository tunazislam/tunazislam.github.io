## Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to infodemic of low quality information leading to poor health decisions. Combating the outcomes of this infodemic is not only a question of identifying false claims, it requires understanding the reasoning behind the decisions individuals make.
In this work we propose a holistic analysis framework connecting stance and reason analysis and fine-grained entity level moral sentiment analysis. We study how to model the dependencies between the different level of analysis and incorporate human insights into the learning process. Our experiments show that our framework can provide reliable predictions even in the low-supervision settings.
